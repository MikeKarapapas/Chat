This is an app created by me for a local quick communication...and you need wi-fi to use it

------ HOW TO USE CLIENT ------
First open the client folder and then open the Client.exe file
Enter a nickname and then the ip of you friends server that you wand to connect.
After you get no errors you can start chatting(There is no "Type here a message" line you just start chatting)...In addition there 's no fancy GUI but I will make a better one in the future...

------ HOW TO USE SERVER ------
Just open the Server folder and then open the Server.exe file
Enter your ip to start a new server
